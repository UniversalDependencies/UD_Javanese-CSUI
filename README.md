# Introduction

UD Javanese-CSUI is a gold standard dependency treebank for Javanese, the regional language that has the most users in Indonesia (more than 80 million native speakers in 2007). 

The sentences were taken from [OPUS](https://opus.nlpl.eu/), the open source parallel corpus, especially from the Javanese section of the WikiMatrix v1 corpus. The sentences in this corpus do not use the original writing system of Javanese ([Hanacaraka](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksara_Jawa)) and use the Roman writing system. We conducted manual correction to some sentences from OPUS, especially for sentences that contain more Indonesian words than Javanese words.

Javanese has three language levels: Krama, Madya, and Ngoko. In this initial version of the Javanese dependency treebank, the sentences are predominantly of Ngoko and Krama languages.
