# Introduction

UD Javanese-CSUI is dependency treebank for Javanese, the regional language that has the most users in Indonesia (more than 60 million native speakers). This treebank was annotated manually. The newest version has 732 sentences and 11K words.

The original sentences were taken from several resources: 
1. Javanese reference grammar books (125 sents)
2. [OPUS](https://opus.nlpl.eu/), especially from the Javanese section of the WikiMatrix v1 corpus (152 sents)
2. Online news (Solopos) (155 sents)

The sentences in this corpus do not use the original writing system of Javanese ([Hanacaraka](https://id.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aksara_Jawa)) and use the Roman writing system. 

Javanese has several language levels, such as Krama, Krama Inggil, and Ngoko. In this Javanese dependency treebank, the sentences are predominantly Ngoko language.
